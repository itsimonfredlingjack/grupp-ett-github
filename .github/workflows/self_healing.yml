            The CI workflow failed.
            Analyze likely root causes and propose a minimal fix.
            If a deterministic safe fix is obvious, commit the fix to
            branch ${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_branch }}.
            Otherwise, open an issue with analysis and a remediation plan.

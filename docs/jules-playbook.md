# Jules playbook

This guide explains how Jules runs in this repository, how you read workflow
outputs, and how you handle common failures. Use it during PR review,
self-healing incidents, and daily health checks.

## Workflow map

The repository uses three workflows so each automation concern stays focused.
`jules_review.yml` handles PR feedback, `self_healing.yml` handles failed CI
runs, and `jules_health_check.yml` validates integration health on schedule.

- **PR review:** `.github/workflows/jules_review.yml`
- **Self-healing:** `.github/workflows/self_healing.yml`
- **Health check:** `.github/workflows/jules_health_check.yml`

## Payload and guardrails

All Jules prompts use `scripts/jules_payload.py` and one compact
`JULES_CONTEXT` object. This keeps payloads short, deterministic, and safe.

- Uses profile budgets: `QUICK_REVIEW`, `HEALING_FIX`, `DEEP_REVIEW`
- Sends top changed files and largest hunks first
- Sends latest relevant log lines, not full logs
- Masks secret-like values and auth headers
- Excludes `vendor/`, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, and binary assets

## Failure taxonomy

`self_healing.yml` classifies failures using `scripts/classify_failure.py`.
Use taxonomy first, then inspect logs.

- `AUTH`, `RATE_LIMIT`, `NETWORK`, `TIMEOUT`
- `CONFIG`, `PERMISSION`
- `TEST_FAIL`, `LINT_FAIL`, `TYPE_FAIL`, `BUILD_FAIL`
- `FLAKY`, `UNKNOWN`

## Metrics and artifacts

Every Jules workflow uploads `artifacts/jules_metrics.json` so runtime behavior
is observable across runs.

- Key fields: workflow, run id, SHA, duration, retries, payload sizes
- Includes Jules session id when available
- Includes `fix_outcome` and classification data for self-healing runs
- Step Summary links back to failing CI run and current run

## Operations checklist

Use this sequence when you investigate Jules behavior.

1. Open the workflow run and read **Step Summary**.
2. Download the metrics artifact and confirm taxonomy and payload sizes.
3. Check cooldown and guardrail outcomes for self-healing runs.
4. If needed, rerun manually with `workflow_dispatch` (health check mode `full`).
5. If failures repeat, open or update the tracking issue with run links.

## Next steps

Keep this playbook in sync with workflow changes. Update it whenever taxonomy,
payload schema, or guardrail behavior changes.
